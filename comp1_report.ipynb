    "## Introduction\n",
    "The weather is a chaotic system. Small variations in wind directions, humidity, etc. can have a tremendous impact on larger meteorological events. Given the complexity of such system, machine learning proves to be a useful tool for modelling the weather and better understanding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a subset of the ClimateNet dataset containing 47,760 labelled weather events with 18 variables, classification models were trained to label meteorological events as either: *standard conditions* (class 0), *tropical cyclone* (class 1), or*atmospheric river* (class 2). The performance of the models was assessed using the error rate on a test set containing 7,320 unlabeled events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data was standardized, and subsets of features were used to train various machine learning algorithms including: *Softmax multiclass logistic regression*, *One-vs-one binary logistic regression*, and *XGBoost*. The best performance was achieved by the XGBoost model with a test accuracy of 0.76721. "

    "## Feature Design\n",
    "The original dataset consists of a table with one row per event, and one column per feature. The 18 features are of varied nature, and use distinct units. This includes longitude-latitude coordinates, precipitations, wind, humidity, sea level, pressure, and dates. Half of training set appeared to duplicated entries (25,763 non-redundant). The duplicates were immediately dropped to avoid them biasing data exploration, and feature distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data exploration\n",
    "First, a widget allowing to visualize 1D histograms for the distribution of features, and 2D scatter plots for pairwise relationships between features was used to explore the data. Several insights gained directed the feature preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Several features appear normally distributed and leptokurtic (U850, V850, UBOT, VBOT, PS, PSL, T200);\n",
    "2. A few features appear unimodal and skewed (T500, TREFHT, Z100, Z200, ZBOT);\n",
    "3. TS is not unimodal;\n",
    "4. PRECT appears to follow a negative logarithmic distribution, and/or has significant outliers;\n",
    "5. Longitude and latitude appear as 7 main points on the scatter plot, and 2 bins for latitude, and 3 bins for longitude on the histograms;\n",
    "6. Events are not uniformally distributed over years. This could be due to data acquisition. A different representation could be more informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decisions regarding feature engineering were based solely on inspecting the training dataset to avoid leakage of information, and keep the test set truly independent. Otherwise, the empirical risk estimate would be biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Extraction\n",
    "[1, 2, 3] For the normally distributed features (including the leptokurtic mentioned above) a Z-score standardization was applied, and for the skewed data a square root standardization was used on all values. TS was also transformed using the square root standardization since it appears correlated with TREFHT (another skewed unimodal feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "[4] For PRECT, the values were scaled up to improve numerical stability. Values below 0 were temporarily imputated (n=606). The log of the transformed values was taken before building an histogram. The new feature used the index of the histogram as value, and the initially imputated values were attributed 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "[5] Based on the visual inspection of the histograms, latitude was divided into 2 bins (above and below 30), and longitude into 3 bins (below 260, between 260 and 300, and above 300), and the indices of the respective bins were returned as values. Since these slices describe seemingly discrete areas, the two columns were one-hot encoded resulting in 5 new columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "[6] Based on the assumption that the rate of meteorological events varies at various time scales, the year and the month of the dates were encoded as two separate ordinal features.\n"

    "## Algorithms\n",
    "Three main approaches were tested on this multiclass classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a softmax logistic regression was implemented from scratch. Its weights and biases are optimized through gradient descent using the cross-entropy loss. The model outputs a prediction probability for each class (summing to 1), and the maximum probability class is attributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, a one-vs-one logistic regression scheme was implemented from scratch. The created model can handle an arbitrary number of label classes. For each pair of classes, it trains a logistic regression (binary classifier) using gradient descent with the binary entropy loss. To generate a prediction, each model outputs a probability for both classes (summing to 1), then the class with the maximum probability is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier algorithm from the xgboost Python package was used. The objective used multiclass softmax, and the evaluation metric was cross-entropy loss."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "Along the feature extraction methods mentioned, functions to realize balanced undersampling, to select a subset of features, and to use cross-validation were implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balanced undersampling consists of identifying the label class with the least number of examples, and randomly selecting an equal number of examples in each other label classes. Balanced sampling helps the model learn the distinctive properties of each class instead simply memorizing the relative frequency of each class. Models were trained with and without balanced undersampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding feature selection, different subsets of features based on their distribution were tried. The feature set including only normally distributed features did not improve performance. The one including all hand-crafted features also didn't significantly improve the models. Finally, the set including all normalized original features lead to the best test performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For cross-validation, the method implemented separates the training set according to class labels, then keeps 70% of each class for training, and sets aside 30% of each class for validation (about the size of the test set). The loss and the error rate were computed on both the training and the validation set. Observing a plateau or an uptrend in any of the two metrics for the validation set guided the hyperparameter selection. Once the hyperparameters were decided, a new model was trained using the full training set to make the final test predictions."

    "## Results\n",
    "The three types of model share the hyperparameters *number of steps*, which dictates the number of gradient descent iterations, and the *learning rate*, which defines the scale of weight changes at each step. The number of steps should be set to the number of iterations when evaluation metrics start to plateau, or the metrics on the validation set diverges. Such trends in a plot would suggest the model is overfitting. Using lower learning rate can smooth the learning curve, but will require an increased number of steps to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models were evaluated using their respective loss, and the error rate (i.e., *n correct  / n total*, or *1 - accuracy*). Due to the limited number of submissions possible on Kaggle, test performance remains unknown for many preprocessing, features, and model configurations. For each type of model, a table containing statistics for models trained on the same preprocessed dataset is available. The *learning rate* was set at 0.05, and  *n_steps* of 30, 70, 100 were tested. The graphs display evaluation metrics up to 200 steps."

It is a challenge to train this ensemble without overfitting individual classifiers, since each require a different number of steps to fit the data. For model (0, 1), the error rate plateaus already at 30 steps, and after 75 for models (0, 2) and (1, 2). Considering these metrics are on the training set (no validation set for this model), it is likely to be overfitting."

    "The XGBoost seem to achieve the best performance because it better preserves class separation. Indeed, XGBoost models achieve lower loss and error rates than Softmax models. This is likely due to its ability to exploit the most informative features. In contrast, the two other approaches did not include regularization terms, and could have been hurt by redundant or irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test performance\n",
    "Because of less than optimal experiment tracking, the full details of the configurations leading to each results is unavailable. The best test accuracy achieved by a Softmax Multiclass Logistic Regression was: 0.76803, for OneVsOne ensemble: 0.74098, and for XGBoost: 0.76803. Even though the type of errors is unknown, it should be noted that Softmax probably achieved this accuracy by never predicting class 1, and being \"blind\" to it."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "Knowing the random baseline has an accuracy of 0.703055, and the first place on the leaderboard achieved 0.79836, the best test accuracy from this work (0.76803) is satisfying. While it beats all baselines, it also highlights that further improvements are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though some feature distributions were multimodal, skewed, or discontinuous, hand-crafted features did not significantly improve performance. An hypothesis for these results would be that the resulting representations (using bins or ordinal values) were more difficult for gradient descent, and had low correlations to the label. For example, the binned longitude and latitude could have been used as ordinal features instead of being one-hot encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, normalizing feature, and selecting non-redundant features was useful. Indeed, two features that seem to describe the same characteristic (e.g., T200 and T500) \"artificially\" increases the importance of this characteristic in the model by having two weights representing it. Removing redundant features allows to better capture distinctions in the data. Also, feature selection helps tree models (i.e., XGBoost) by avoiding consecutive splits on redundant feature, which would lead to overfitting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since the Kaggle competition format limits the number of performance assessment on the test set, and it is partially hidden, more thorough model evaluation would have been beneficial. Adding an hyperparameter grid-search could would help find ideal hyperparameter combinations, in particular for L1 and L2 penalties. In addition, k-fold cross-validation could improve confidence in models by limiting the influence of a particular train set (i.e., bias), and avoiding overfitting hyperparameters. "
